TerretUp is a meeting point where ideas and projects are connected; a living laboratory, participatory and open to the public. The people who work in this ecosystem are at the center of the action and give life to dynamic spaces, meeting rooms, relaxation and training, and turn the set into a space to create unique experiences. Coworking inaugurates a new concept of collaborative workspace where people and companies come together to activate a real and meaningful social transformation.'

			'Creation of the corporate image of Coopernic, a European project for the creation of companies and social economy entities in which the purpose is to provide advisory services to entrepreneurs in social economy. The proposal is based on making the Associated Worker Cooperative formula known to entrepreneurs, based on its suitability for the challenges of the present and the future, in which the cohesion and adaptability of human teams will be especially relevant. These teams will act as loudspeakers of the initiative, given that the people linked to them share the values of the cooperatives without being aware of it.'

Our proposal is to create pen pals, young and old will be involved in writing letters to listen, understand and learn from each generation through writing, a means of communication that connects these two generations. To let them know that we are interested in hearing from them and to let them see that they are not invisible and that we care about them. With this advertising project we made an advertising spot, illustration of the characters of our deck and the prototype of the web campaign.'
